# slider
first introduction to android development. Created a very simple game, the Slider.

I added the 'main' file that is created in Android Studio when a new project is created.
Just replace it.

The main focus of this project was to learn more about Java but also try to figure out Android Studio,
The game is not meant to be perfect it is purely a programming learning experience that I'd like to share.
The main focus as well was to have an AI algorithm, to play against.

I was helped by many people, but all the code is 100% the fruit of my brain.
I really enjoyed using Android Studio, however this game is not optimized at all, keep in mind that it was a learning
experience, now that i look at the code with more knowledge, I see that I could have used more features that Android Studio
already has, but it was great to learn more Java.
